# NSHC-LLVM-Lab-Blog

Welcome to the official technical blog and research archive of the NSHC LLVM Lab.
We’re currently in the process of setting up the initial structure and preparing our first series of technical articles, so please note that this repository is still under construction.

🧬 About NSHC LLVM Lab
Established in December 2022, the NSHC LLVM Lab is a practical research unit dedicated to compiler-based security solutions.
Following the successful development of LxShield, our flagship LLVM-based obfuscation engine, the lab now focuses on deepening core technologies and expanding their applications into industry, defense, and marine systems.

🔬 Research Focus
Our interests revolve around open-source compilers—especially LLVM—and include:

Compiler-based obfuscation & deobfuscation, with a focus on LLVM IR

Virtualized execution models such as WebAssembly and eBPF

Formal verification tools like Alive2 and KLEE, built on SMT solvers

Domain-specific compilers with HW/SW co-design, using FPGAs and GPUs to enhance security and performance

🚀 Key Achievements
LxShield is a mature LLVM-based obfuscation solution, widely used in the Korean financial sector.  
Commercialized in 2019, it offers full support for modern LLVM/Swift, with CI/CD and end-to-end compiler workflows.

🛠️ Expected Updates Soon
📚 Introductory materials and internal training guides for new team members  
🧱 Ongoing development of a sandbox-driven, cyber-resilient compiler software stack  
✅ Prototyping and validation of LLVM IR transformations using Alive2
